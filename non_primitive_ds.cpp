// Non-Primitive data strutures
//   Derived from primitive data structures
//     thus, also called derived or complex data structures
//   Can store multiple values of SAME as well as DIFFERENT TYPE
//   Represent relationship between different data elements
//   Size can be changed dynamically

// TYPES OF PRIMTIVE DATA STRUCTURES
// 1) Linear DS
//    Elements are arranged sequentially
//    So, each element(except the first and last) has a
//     i) predecessor
//    and ii) successor

// a) Array
//   A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations

//  ADVANTAGES
//    Fast access(elements can be directly accessed by indexing)
//    Memory efficient(uses minimal amount of memory)

//  DISADVANTAGES
//    Fixed size(cannot be shrinked or expanded dynamically)
//    Homogenous data storage
//    Requires one large contiguous block of memory, which 
//       does not exist sometimes
